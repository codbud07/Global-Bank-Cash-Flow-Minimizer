# 🌟 Global Bank Cash-Flow Minimizer
This project is a C++-based interactive system designed to minimize the total number of monetary transactions between international banks using multiple payment methods. It leverages a graph-based debt settlement algorithm and even considers intermediary transactions via a World Bank when banks don’t share a common payment mode.
# 🚀 Objective
To minimize the number of financial transactions required to settle debts among several banks across the globe, while respecting constraints on available payment modes per bank.
# 🔍 Motivation
In real-world financial systems, banks or financial institutions often operate across different payment ecosystems. Some banks accept only local payment options (e.g., Paytm, AliPay), making direct settlements difficult. This system ensures:
1. Optimal debt settlement
2. Minimal transaction hops
3. Payment mode compatibility
4. Usage of a World Bank intermediary only when absolutely necessary
# 🔖 Example Scenario
**Banks Involved:**
1. Bank_of_America ➔ ⭐ World Bank
2. Wells_Fargo
3. Goldman_Sachs
4. Royal_Bank_of_Canada
5. Westpac
6. National_Australia_Bank
